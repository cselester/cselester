# Hey there! 👋 I'm Tushar (aka cselester)

Engineering student 🛠️ | AI builder 🤖 | Chaos coordinator 🌪️  
Currently crafting multi-agent systems, fraud detectors, and chasing the thrill of solving the "unsolvable".

## ⚡ What I'm up to:

- 🕵️‍♂️ **FraudGuard**  
  A lightweight, AI-powered fraud detection system.  
  Flask + scikit-learn + SQLite + Twilio = real-time fraud alerts.

-  **CustoVista**  
  A multi-agent system for customer insights, segmentation, fraud analytics, and recommendations.  
  Built with Groq/Ollama LLMs, synthetic data, Gradio UI, and a whole lot of logic.

## 🔧 Tech Stack I Mess With:

- Python • JavaScript • SQL  
- Scikit-learn • HuggingFace • LangChain  
- Flask • FastAPI • Gradio  
- SQLite • PostgreSQL • FAISS  
- Google Colab • Ollama • Groq API

## 🌌 Why "cselester"?

Inspired by a character from **GTA V** — not the main guy, but the one with the power to do the *undoable*.  
That’s the energy I bring to tech too. I may not always be center stage,  
but I *build things that move mountains*. 🚀  
"cselester" is my reminder that skill > spotlight.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build AI systems that actually help people  
- Intern at places where curiosity is currency  
- Keep learning, shipping, and leveling up — always
